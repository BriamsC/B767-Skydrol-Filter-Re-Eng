# B767-Skydrol-Filter-Re-Eng
This project details the reverse engineering of a Skydrol filtration unit from a B767-200. Due to part unavailability, I created 3D models and CAD drawings and performed a feasibility analysis for remanufacturing. This showcases skills in design, analysis, and problem-solving in an aviation context.
